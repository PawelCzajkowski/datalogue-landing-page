# Description

This is a source code of the landing page to my app idea.
To make this webpage I used JavaScript and React. For styling is used tailwindCSS.

Page has different styling for mobile devices.

Page is published on https://www.datalogue.pl/

## Development

For development run `npm run dev`

Tailwind build process `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch`

To build `npm run build`

To preview `npm run preview`


## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
